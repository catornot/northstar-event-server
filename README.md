# northstar-event-server
nixos system config to host northstar servers on a vps or smth

# Setup
Get the template
```
git clone https://github.com/catornot/northstar-event-server.git
```

1. replace nixos/hardware-configuration.nix with the hardware-configuration.nix generated by `nixos-generate-config`
2. look in the flake.nix
change user and hostname if you want
3. in nixos/configuration.nix
  - edit stuff that you need idk
  - install some packages maybe? in `environment.systemPackages`
  - most importantly set ssh keys in `openssh.authorizedKeys.keys`
4. under modules/northstar-server.nix customize the server
  - add ssh keys to rcon (which will allow people to access the server console via ssh over a rcon shell)
  - set port to the correct port
